    <h4>Better User Experience Through Storytelling</h4>
    <p>
        Framing my project in a story format can help fine-tune my ideas by forcing me to give my ideas structure by defining stages in my ideas. It focuses a “story” around the User as a protagonist and gives it a beginning, middle, and an end. This process can help me find the gaps and inconsistencies within my project, as well as redundancy in my thinking. By refocusing on the user in this story-like way, it helps me become more aware of their needs, conflicts, motivations, etc. This allows me to look outward in my creative process and not just focus on myself and what I think I need to put on the websites to make me happy. My design decisions would become more intentional and cohesive. Storytelling as a whole will act as a great way to critique my project, adding clarity and transforming ideas into user-centric solutions.

        Different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design are size, weight, color, space, position/alignment, typeface/selection, case, and italics/underlining. All of these methods establish a focal point and create a hierarchy based on the path our eye follows.

    <h2>Creative Brief</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> New and experienced plant owners often struggle to find advice that's trustworthy when caring for a plant or crop. They have to deal with contradictory advice when looking online, with plant blogs, and even with the people who sell them plants and plant-related products. Finding retailers is also an issue, as well as trading seeds on social media groups, which becomes a complicated affair. The plant process as a whole leads to a lot of frustration, misdiagnosis, and dead plants.
